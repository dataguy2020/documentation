SIMP is an Open Source, fully automated, and extensively tested framework that can either enhance your existing infrastructure or allow you to quickly build one from scratch. Built on the mature Puppet product suite, SIMP is designed around scalability, flexibility, and compliance. 

Initially designed as a turn-key solution for isolated environments, SIMP includes everything you need to get started building repeatable infrastructures at any scale.

The core capabilities of SIMP are; 

* PKI

Fully manage the distribution of key materials throughout your environment and be assured that SIMP services are seamlessly protected.

* LDAP

Centralized accouunt management provides effective real-time administration of users

* Host-based Firewall

System-level network protection and logging across all managed systems. All exposed services running on the system have an enforced firewall policy.

* Secure Remote Access
Encrypt and authenticate remote system communications. Privieged user access restriction and enforced access control groups help detect insider threats and prevent unauthorized access. 

* Audit Management

Audit privileged and invalid user activity by actively collection critical security events across the managed infrastructure.

* Unauthorized Service Prevention

Authorize the services that you want to run either system wide or selectively by host. Disable and report on services that have been enabled without authorization.
